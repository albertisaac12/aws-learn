# Cloud Computing Fundamentals

## üß† Computer Analogy

| Component  | Analogy |
|------------|---------|
| CPU + Memory (RAM) | Brain |
| Storage | Data |
| Database | Structured data storage |
| Network | Cables, routers, switches, DNS servers |

### Network Components
- **Network**: Cables, routers, and servers connected together.
- **Router**: Forwards data packets between computer networks; knows where to send packets on the internet.
- **Switch**: Receives a packet and sends it to the correct server or client within your network.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è What is Cloud Computing?

- **On-demand delivery** of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources.
- **Pay-as-you-go pricing** model.
- Provision **exactly the right type and size** of computing resources needed.
- Access resources **instantly and at scale**.
- Provides a **simple way to access** servers, storage, databases, and application services via a web application.

> **Note:** Providers like AWS own and maintain the network-connected hardware required for these services while you provision and use what you need.

## üåê Cloud Deployment Models

| Model | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Private Cloud** | Cloud services used by a single organization, not exposed to the public. |
| **Public Cloud** | Services operated by third parties and delivered over the internet (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP). |
| **Hybrid Cloud** | Combination of on-premises infrastructure with cloud services for extended capabilities. |

## ‚≠ê Five Characteristics of Cloud

1. **On-demand self-service**: Provision resources without human interaction.
2. **Broad network access**: Resources accessible over the network via diverse client platforms.
3. **Multi-tenancy & Resource pooling**: Multiple customers share infrastructure securely.
4. **Rapid elasticity & scalability**: Scale resources up/down quickly as needed.
5. **Measured service**: Usage is monitored and billed accordingly.

## ‚úÖ Advantages of Cloud Computing

1. Trade **CAPEX for OPEX** (Reduced Total Cost of Ownership).
2. Benefit from **massive economies of scale**.
3. **Stop guessing capacity**, scale based on actual usage.
4. Increase **speed and agility**.
5. **Stop spending** money on running and maintaining data centers.
6. **Go global in minutes**.

## üîß Problems Solved by Cloud

- **Flexibility**: Change resource types as needed.
- **Cost-effectiveness**: Pay only for what you use.
- **Scalability**: Handle larger loads via stronger hardware or additional nodes.
- **Elasticity**: Scale out and in dynamically.
- **High availability & fault tolerance**: Build services across data centers.

## üõ†Ô∏è Types of Cloud Services

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **IaaS** (Infrastructure as a Service) | Provides building blocks for cloud IT (networking, compute, storage). Highest flexibility; parallels traditional on-prem IT. |
| **PaaS** (Platform as a Service) | Removes the need to manage underlying infrastructure; focus on deploying and managing applications. |
| **SaaS** (Software as a Service) | Completed products run and managed by the service provider. |

### üìå Summary

Cloud computing provides scalable, flexible, and cost-effective IT resources accessible over the internet with minimal management effort, enabling businesses to innovate and operate efficiently at global scale.
